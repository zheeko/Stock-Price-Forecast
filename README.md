# Stock-Price-Forecast
Forecasting Stock Market Price Movement with Machine Learning Algorithms using  High Frequency Data.
This project conducts a comprehensive trend analysis of General Electric's (GE) stock price movement as well as an exploration of the performance of machine learning algorithms in stock price forecasting.
The weighted average F1-score is an important measure in machine learning evaluation because it reveals the algorithms' precision-recall balance. Notably, the Decision Tree algorithm outperforms its competitors, earning an outstanding weighted average F1-score of 49%. This is closely followed by SVM at 39.40% and Logistic Regression at 33.3%. This discernible difference reflects the Decision Tree algorithm's skill in balancing genuine positives and true negatives, which contributes to its higher prediction skills. 
The accuracy metric emphasises the algorithms' prediction abilities even more. With an accuracy of 49.9%, the Decision Tree algorithm prevails once more. SVM comes in second with 39%, while Logistic Regression comes in third with 36.9%. This significant variation in accuracy demonstrates the Decision Tree algorithm's ability to capture the intricate dynamics of market movements.
The precision and recall metrics provide useful information about the algorithms' ability to balance false positives and false negatives. Decision Tree obtain a precision and recall of 50% each, which dominate SVM and Logistic Regression with 39% and 37% respectively.
In conclusion, this investigation reveals the Decision Tree algorithm as the optimal candidate for predicting stock prices due to its remarkable performance across various metrics. Its ability to negotiate the complexity of stock market patterns is demonstrated by its weighted average F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall. Its capacity to interpret sophisticated data patterns considerably improves its forecasting abilities.
